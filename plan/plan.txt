1)Make converstion routines to convert floating point code to any format
  Eg: convert 2.3 to Q format 2.29 etc
2)Take a small C program, say a mac operation using some data set of float
values and convert it into fixed.Figure out the dynamic range , decide on the
Q format to be used and then figure out how much of a error this Q format
choice introduced
